Booker Study Mapper 

"Booker Study Mapper” Description 

Our study application is a scheduling application specifically targeted towards students at the post-secondary level. We may consider making an app for students of all ages, if we can design the UI intuitively enough. 

Our project has multiple use cases and functions = 

Basic Functionality (Must Have’s) 

Assign tasks, labs, and assignments and their associated due dates. 

Schedule class times and appointments. 

Assign work or study periods where we can work on Assignments or study material. 

Notifications for classes, work periods, and study time. 

Booker Distinctive Functionality (Differing from Competitors; Should Have’s) 

Pie graph which shows how much time you spend on a particular course, and how much time is spent studying or doing assignments. 

Simple way to copy your grades into the app, and track progress & grade %. 

Advanced Functionality (Optional; Could Have’s) 

Collaborative tool to join groups, notify others of Assignment progress, notifying teammates of block progress (see Codex.com) 

I believe this would be a good assignment as being students ourselves, we have direct experience with the struggles of time management, especially regarding planning our off-hours for Assignment work or studying. Many other study applications don’t have some of the planning features described above, where we can plan out our time based on priority, available time, and difficulty.
